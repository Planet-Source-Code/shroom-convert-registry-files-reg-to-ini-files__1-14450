## Convert Registry Files \(\.REG\) to INI Files\!


</div>

### Description

I whipped this up because a huge project I worked on used the registry to store an enormous amount of settings. Rather than lose them all, which couldn't be regained, I ported them to a .REG file and then took a look at the format. Noticed a pattern, so I made this to convert a REG file to an INI! I've only tested it on my Win2k and WinME setup, and any feedback would be appreciated!
